Software Engineer (APP - React Native) Test

Description
This will be a 2 hour test. You can build this in React Native. Basically you will be required
to build 2 screens only, and ensure that all the required features listed below are working
correctly. Using the latest language and architecture (MVC, MVVM, VIPER) will be an
added advantage.

Features
1) At Screen1, list all the contacts based on the information retrieved from data.json as
shown as in screen1.png.
2) Clicking on any contact, will redirect the user to the Screen2 as shown in screen2.png
3) At Screen2, the user will be able to edit the contact’s information. First Name and Last
Name are required fields, while Email and Phone are optional fields.
4) Screen 2 should be scrollable and clicking “next” in the keyboard, must bring the user to
the next input field.
5) Clicking on the Save button, will update the list at Screen1.
6) A pull to refresh at Screen 1 will force the App to refresh the list according to the
information retrieved from data.json.
7) The search and + button must be there, but the functionality can be omitted.
8) You can use any required dependency to finish up the task, but it must be kept to
minimal usage. Using lesser dependency will be an added advantage as well.
